                    On Wednesday, we went and visited CMA CGM. They are the 5th largest shipping company in the world, and they contribute to 0.01% Of all global emissions.
                    Multiple upper management types spoke to us, covering various topics.
                </br>The first topic I want to talk about was their move to being carbon-neutral. What this looks like is a phase from burning fossil fuels to more carbon-friendly fuel options. Things like Biodiesel and the move to hydro-fuels will trend their carbon emissions down, towards the goal of 0 by 2050. One technology they mentioned was sail-assisted shipping. Which, it appears, we have simply re-invented the wheel. This time it's made of metals and carbon fiber!
                </br>The second topic and more relevant topic I wanted to talk about was the Big Data topic. This guy walked us through how their current goal is to make their ships more efficient. The first thing he talked through is how they route their ships. By using physics-informed machine learning techniques and a weather simulator, they are able to navigate ships to their most efficient routes, reducing carbon emissions by up to 20% per trip.
