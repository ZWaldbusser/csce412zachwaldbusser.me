                <h1>Technical Interests </h1>
                <h2>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>In high school, I took coursera courses to verse myself as a programmer. 
                <br>One of the first few courses I took pertained to Machine Learning, and since then I have had a fascination with the subject.</p>

                <h2>Data Science</h2>
                <p>Similar to AI/ML, however my interest in Data Science stemmed from it!
                <br>Realizing that the crux of training models was being knowledgeable in Data Science, I understand its importance in the field.
                </p>

                <h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
                <p>This interest stems from my CPU Design project.
                <br>Having worked with a simulated piece of hardware, writing C code that runs on learning boards was brief passion project of mine.
                </p>

                <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
                <p>Software Engineering is the foundation of Computer Science. Its like the whole thing!
                <br>Software Engineering is my overarching interest, as it encapsulates so much of what I just mentioned.
