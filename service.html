                <br>My dedication to service didn't start in college, it started way earlier.
                <br>Throughout middle school and highschool, my parents would always, almost <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YalgKfrOdsI">Faithfully</a>, take our family to volunteer at the Central Texas Food Bank.
                <br>Be it packing orders, sorting dry goods, or checking fruit to see if it was still fresh, my family spent many Saturdays in that warehouse.
                <br>In addition to CTFB, I also worked closely with <a href="https://www.operationgratitude.com/">Operation Gratitude</a>, whos mission is to "say Thank You to our Military and First Reponder communities".
                <br>Working with Operation Gratitude consisted of various projects, all aimed towards helping out our armed forces and veteran communities.

                <h2><a href="https://ymsl.org/">YMSL</a></h2>
                <p>I didn't join YMSL until my junior year of high school, as a "legacy" due to my younger brother having entered the organization.
                <br>As an older member (and new member), I had an incredibly steep hour requirement as oposed to my younger brother.
                <br>However despite this, I cleared the yearly service requirement with a margin of 15 hours.
                <br>Due to this fact (and my ability to help the Moms run Zoom meetings during COVID), I was selected out of all my peers to win the Heart of YMSL award, awarded once yearly.

                <p>MSC FISH (Memorial Student Center Freshmen in Service and Hosting) is a FLO at Texas A&M
                <br>Dedicating itself to service, MSC FISH is the FLO that contributes the most to it's community.
                <br>In addition to having one of the highest hours requirements of any FLO, it also runs <a href="https://mscprograms.tamu.edu/donate/msc-extra/kyle-field-day/">Kyle Field Day</a>, which is an event that hosts tons of small-scall service projects and organizations.
                <br>I was in this organization for two years. Once as a member, and the following year as a staff member.
                <br>Through MSC FISH, I learned that despite being a busy college student, if you love something enough, you will make time for it. Be it service events or opportunities, I found ways to take part in both.
